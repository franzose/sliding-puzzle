# Sliding Puzzle
What is it?

> A sliding puzzle, **sliding block puzzle**, or **sliding tile puzzle** is a tour puzzle that challenges a player to slide (frequently flat) pieces along certain routes (usually on a board) to establish a certain end-configuration. The pieces to be moved may consist of simple shapes, or they may be imprinted with colors, patterns, sections of a larger picture (like a jigsaw puzzle), numbers, or letters.<br><br>— [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle)

## The Game
This repository represents an implementation of the game written in JavaScript using some features of the ES6 syntax and is ‘backendless’. But I plan to show later (in separate repositories) how backend can be written in different PHP frameworks.
